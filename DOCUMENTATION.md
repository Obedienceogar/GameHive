- `functions.py`: Collection of utility functions used throughout the project.
- `game_temp.py`: Handled a quick test runs.
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the application.
- `question example.txt`: Example of question formatting or sample data for input.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required Python packages for the project.
- `trivia learning.py`: Implements trivia-learning features or automated question generation.
- `user.py`: Handles user profiles, authentication, and user-related logic.
- `variables.py`: Contains global or shared variables for configuration.
